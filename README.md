This was a group project I was apart of when I took a Software Engineering course.  

Our project idea was to build a classroom teaching aid that would make many of the day to day activities of a school teacher simpler and more streamlined. 

SchoolMarm is designed to give teachers a software program that will help them stay organized through attendance, seating plans, infractions of students, and of course their daily lesson plan.
